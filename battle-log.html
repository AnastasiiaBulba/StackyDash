                Building bridges is the heart of Stacky Dash. After dozens of
                hours playing and experimenting, I’ve uncovered some essential
                tips for new and experienced players alike:<br /><br />
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Always collect extra tiles before attempting long bridges.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Look ahead to spot the safest landing spots and avoid dead
                    ends.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use short bridges to access bonus tiles that can extend your
                    run.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice timing to place tiles precisely and avoid falling.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Master these techniques, and you’ll be unstoppable on your way
                to the top of the leaderboard!
